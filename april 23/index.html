Respected Principal,

I am writing this application to request a leave of absence from school for [number of days] days, starting from [start date] to [end date] as I will be going out of station with my family during this period.

I have completed all my assignments and submitted them to my respective teachers. I will also make sure to catch up with the missed classes and complete all the notes and homework after my return.

I request you to kindly grant me leave for the mentioned period. I will be extremely grateful for your understanding and cooperation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]

[Your Class]
